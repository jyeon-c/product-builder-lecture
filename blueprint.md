# Lotto Number Generator

## Overview

This project is a simple, visually appealing lottery number generator. It allows users to generate a set of random lottery numbers with the click of a button. The application is built using modern web technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on a clean, component-based architecture using Web Components.

## Design and Features

*   **UI/UX:** The application features a clean and modern design with a "glassmorphism" effect for the main container. It's responsive and includes interactive elements like a button with a subtle glow effect.
*   **Lottery Number Generation:** The core feature is the ability to generate 6 unique random numbers between 1 and 45.
*   **Web Components:** The lottery number display is encapsulated in a custom element (`lotto-ball`) for reusability and maintainability.
*   **Animation:** The generated numbers fade in for a smoother user experience.

## Current Plan

*   **Objective:** Transform the initial "Hello World" page into a fully functional and styled lottery number generator.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Update `index.html`:** Set up the basic structure for the lottery generator, including a title, a container for the numbers, and a "Generate" button.
    2.  **Update `style.css`:** Apply a modern and visually appealing style to the page, including a background texture, a "glassmorphism" container, and styles for the lottery balls and button.
    3.  **Update `main.js`:** Implement the logic for generating the lottery numbers and create a custom element (`<lotto-ball>`) to display each number in a styled ball.
